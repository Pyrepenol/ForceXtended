## About

This skin is based on "ForceX System Monitor" by ForceX.

I've completely re-written the codebase and added many new features.

Thanks to famfamfam for the awesome icons.

## Install

To install the skin visit the Deviant Art page and download the easy-to-install Rainmeter Skin Package.

You'll also find help and assistance in the comments.
